Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors Camera Game! This project uses a TeachableMachine trained model to recognize the hand symbol you make in order to play Rock Paper Scissors
against a computer. To run this program, an initial setup will need to be completed. Download NodeJS, opencv, and follow the instructions in Step 3 of this tutorial: https://www.hackster.io/mjdargen/easy-object-detection-with-teachable-machine-python-d4063b#toc-step-3--setting-up-python-environment--opencv-and-tensorflow-2
 (CD to the teacable machine repository to follow those steps).  
 If you have any questions or comments, contact NishEatsWafflez on GitHub  
 After everything is setup, CD to the gui folder and run `npm start`    to launch the program.
